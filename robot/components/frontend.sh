# What I am planning to have ?
# 1) If any steps fails, I don't want to proceed further and want to break the script. 
# 2) I want validation to happen first and then if it's a root or sudo user,then only I want to run. If not, I'd like to break the script.
# 3) I would like to add Success / Failure messages next to each instruction.
