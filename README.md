# shell-scripting

Welcome to Shell Scirpting.

In this repo you can find the scripts and the menthodology to learb bash / shell scripting.
All the automations related to project can be see in the respective folders.


### Git Commands that I've used 

```
 git clone https:url ( Will clone / download the whole repo )
 git add . / file    ( git will start tracking the changes and moves the files to staging area )
 git commit -m "Msg" ( Commiting the changes to local repository) 
 git push            ( pushes the changes to remote repository / GitHub )
 git pull            ( Pull the changes from repo since the last clone )

```

I've cloned the repository and have added few changed or filed and then I'd like tp push the changes back to GitHub repo.

### Here is the flow to follow : 

```
1) Clone the repo using `git clone url`
2) Open the repo in VS Code / Editor, do the changes 
3) git add . ; git commit -m "Msg telling what you've done" ; git push 
4) Changes that you made are pushed 
5) On your server, do a `git clone URL` for the first time and from second time to test, just do a `git pull`

```

## Project Automation will be done with
